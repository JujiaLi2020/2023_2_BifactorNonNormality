# 2023_2_BifactorNonNormality
This repository contains the code, simulation scripts, and analysis outputs for a study investigating the performance of MAP and ML estimation methods in the bifactor graded response model (Bifactor-GRM). The project explores how violations of the normality assumption—specifically skewness and kurtosis in general and specific latent traits—affect the accuracy of item and person parameter recovery.
